% The library is modal: it is either in the construction/configuration stage or
% in the simulation stage. nemoCreateSimulation switches from
% construction/configuration to simulation and nemoDestroySimulation switches
% back again. Functions are classified as either configuration, construction,
% or simulation functions, and can only be used in the appropriate stage.
%
% NeMo provides the functions listed below. See the documentation for the
% respective functions for more detail.
