# First, create the file  ~/.local/share/mime/packages/application-x-foobar.xml:

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/mime/packages
cd ~/.local/share/mime/packages
touch application-x-foobar.xml


# Then edit ~/.local/share/mime/packages/application-x-foobar.xml and add this text:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mime-info xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info">
    <mime-type type="application/x-foobar">
        <comment>foo file</comment>
        <icon name="application-x-foobar"/>
        <glob-deleteall/>
        <glob pattern="*.foo"/>
    </mime-type>
</mime-info>

# Note that you can use any icon, including one for another application


# Next, edit or create the file  ~/.local/share/applications/foobar.desktop to contain something like:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Foobar
Exec=/usr/bin/foobar
MimeType=application/x-foobar
Icon=foobar
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=AudioVideo;Player;Video;
Comment=

# Note that Categories should be set appropriately for the application type (in this example, a multimedia app).

# Now update the applications and mime database with:

update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
update-mime-database    ~/.local/share/mime

# Programs that use mime types, such as file managers, should now open *.foo files with foobar. 

# Restart file manager 

nautilus -q

nautilus



# Adding an Icon
# Now we need to associate an icon with the MIME type. Get an SVG icon and name it "text-extension.svg", or whatever your modified MIME type is named; this will be the icon to represent all instances of the MIME type on your system. For our python example, this is a good choice. Rename the .svg file so that the it matches "text-x-python.svg" (or "insertYourMIMEtype.svg") so that the slashes are replaced with "-" and there are no capital letters.
# Then simply run the following commands, with 'text-x-python' replaced with your MIME type.

sudo cp application-x-brainstudio.svg /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/mimetypes
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/gnome/ -f



# Create the desktop file and run:

desktop-file-install --dir=/home/zf509/.local/share/applications brainstudio.desktop
