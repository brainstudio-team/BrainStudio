New:
 - SOS: Awesome feature: Make default templates for different simulators and make
   a function on BS where you can create or edit a module from within the front end!!
   It will be something like a simple version of a python IDE like spider that will allow
   you to edit the python file that contains your model!
   In this way, people will be able to easily use their old models again in new simulations
   even if the new simulation was made with another simulator!



For Dave:
 - Default parameters (after request) for nodes and edges. Even better, 
   different sets of parameters with a title (e.g. excitatory parameters, etc.)

For me:
 - fix memory leak in connections (I use new Connection() but not delete)

 - Trasfer mem.pot instead of spikes

 - Fix LoadTab connections and 'new XXX' stuff.

 - Fix actions. Actions should change any kind of parameter in a model

 - When ESC press pause and then disconnect!

 - SOS: Make another 'block' function that when initialization of the block has
   finished, it synchs it with data from the backend and sets the units_field
   as well as moves params that are normally states to states. ;)

 - NewBlock and NewCOnnection should not allow blocks/connections if not all fields non-empty. 


 - Pass the correct Simulator pointer to the stimulation widget (and update it whenever I change sim).

 - Move controls widget to the architecture widget so it re-scales along with the latter.

 - Implement 'save as' - use 'save as' as the default when no name has been specified.

 - Fix tabs so the user can close them with the 'X' button.

 - Fix style sheet of tabs so the bar above can be merged with them.
